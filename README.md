## Meetups

RubySG meetups are held once a month, on a Tuesday.

For updates on the latest meetup, please check us out on [Meetup.com](http://www.meetup.com/Singapore-Ruby-Group/).

## Data SIM Card

At Changi Airport you can buy a S$12 Singtel (100GB, 14 days) or Starhub (100GB, 10 days) plan. Alternatively, you can buy an Airalo eSIM before you arrive from US$4.50.

You can also go into most convenience stores (eg. 7-11) and buy a pre-paid simcard
from either SingTel or StarHub (or possibly M1).

- [SingTel plans](https://www.singtel.com/personal/products-services/mobile/prepaid-plans/hi-tourist)
- [StarHub plans](https://www.starhub.com/personal/mobile/mobile-phones-plans/prepaid-cards/travel-sim.html)
- [Airalo plans](https://www.airalo.com/singapore-esim)

## Power Plugs

The standard in Singapore is 230V Type G (three pin) sockets.
![Type G](https://www.iec.ch/themes/custom/iec/images/world-plugs/types/G/G_dia_sock_l.png)

Most hotels have universal plugs that work with Type C (two pin) plugs, but you should consider bringing a travel adapter just in case.

## Currency

It's a good idea to bring [Singapore dollars
(SGD)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singapore_dollar) when visiting. However
you can easily get cash out at ATMs after you arrive if necessary. While
credit cards are widely accepted here, cash is still king, especially at [Hawker centres](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hawker_centre). 

Some retailers have a habit of adding additional surcharges for credit card purchases, so, you might find that you get a small "discount" for paying with cash.

## Free WiFi

Changi Airport offers [3 hour free wifi](https://www.changiairport.com/en/airport-guide/facilities-and-services/internet-connection.html). 

[Wireless@SG](https://www.imda.gov.sg/how-we-can-help/wireless-at-sg/wireless-at-sg-for-consumers) is an open network available at almost every shopping mall, library and public space.

You can also consider checking out the [cafes with free wi-fi](http://www.ladyironchef.com/2013/08/cafes-free-wifi-singapore/)

## Goods and Services Tax (GST)

Do take note that Singapore imposes a 9% levy on nearly all forms of goods and services. The prices for goods almost always include the GST. The restaurants menus however usually exclude the GST and service charge. It's common practice for restaurants to include a text at the bottom of menus for "++" which indicate additional tax and service charge respectively.

## Tipping

It's not expected to leave a tip in Singapore. Although feel free to leave a few coins at the end of your meal if you feel like it.

Hawker centres are mostly self-service and don't have service charges. Restaurants typically add 10% service charge to your final bill.

## Tissue Culture

Singaporeans often leave tissues on tables in busy food courts and hawker centres before they order their food to "reserve" the table. You might be tempted to remove it, but don't. Just find another table and use your own tissue to reserve it.

If you don't have a tissue, most hawker centres sell one at the drink stall for S$0.30. Alternatively, there's usually an older lady or gentleman offering multiple for a dollar or two, feel free to buy from them.

## Communication

English is widely spoken everywhere. You might hear [Singlish](https://www.aussiepete.com/2008/05/singlish-language-guide-for-foreigners.html) from time to time among Singaporeans. It's fun to learn, but you will sound silly if you try to imitate it.

## Shopping

Here are a few food suggestions to bring back home:

- [Bak Kwa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bakkwa), a Chinese salty-sweet dried meat product similar to jerky. 
  [Bee Cheng Hiang](http://www.beechenghiang.com.sg/our-story/our-bakkwa.html) or [Lim Chee Guan](http://www.limcheeguan.com.sg/) are both good options.
- [Pandan Cake](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pandan_cake) or [Kueh Lapis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kue_lapis) from [Bengawan Solo](https://bengawansolo.sg)
- Pineapple cakes from [Sunny Hills](https://www.sunnyhills.com.sg/collections/all-pineapple-cakes-product)
- Kaya Jam and Kopi powder from [Ya Kun](http://yakun.com/menu/merchandise)
- Bak Kut Teh products from [Song Fa](https://songfa.com.sg/pages/retail-products)

## Don'ts

Avoid these while in Singapore:

- Vandalism
- Littering
- Drugs
- Chewing gum
- Eating and drinking in public transport. You can be fined for it. This is especially true for MRT stations and trains.
- Carry [Durian](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Durian) in public transport

You *really* don't want to commit crimes here. Singapore
takes its law and order very seriously - one of the reasons it's a very nice
place to live.

## Getting Around

Public transport in Singapore is excellent and probably should be
your first choice.

You can certainly get to many places –especially in central areas– by walking, but keep in mind that it's always hot and humid. Always carry a hat, umbrella and stay hydrated.

### Taxis and Private Hires

The most commonly used private hire apps in Singapore are [Grab](https://www.grab.com/sg/) and [Tada](https://tada.global). Download either/both to hail a ride (similar to Uber).

You can also wait at a taxi stand, but this could be a challenge during peak hours or rainy days. You can also check out [Taxi Router Explorer](https://taxirouter.sg/).

### MRT and Buses

The public transport system in Singapore is excellent and affordable. You can use any Visa/Mastercard Debit or Credit card (or a digital version) to pay for your ride. You do not need to download anything, but there's a [SimplyGo app](https://www.lta.gov.sg/content/dam/ltagov/getting_around/public_transport/pdf/LR9364%2B9293D_LTA_400x210_8pp_%20Eng.pdf) for you to download and register if you need details on your charges.

Alternatively, you can get a prepaid [EZ-link card](https://www.ezlink.com.sg/get-your-ez-link-card/where-the-cards-are-sold/) at most MRT stations and bus interchanges.

[MRT trains](http://www.smrt.com.sg/Trains/NetworkMap.aspx) are frequent, clean and fast, although they can get crowded during rush hour. You can check out [MRT Rail Routes Explorer](https://railrouter.sg).

[Buses](http://www.sbstransit.com.sg/) are also widely available, clean and comfortable, especially for shorter distances. You can check out [Singapore Bus Routes Explorer](https://busrouter.sg).

### Transport Apps

- Google Maps ([iOS](https://itunes.apple.com/sg/app/google-maps-real-time-navigation/id585027354?mt=8), [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.apps.maps&hl=en))

  Fully featured transport app that provides you different route options, where to alight, which part of the train you should enter and heat-safe options.

## Food

Singapore has excellent food variety, from affortable hawker fare to Michelin starred restaurants. Singaporeans can be quite opiniated about their favourites, so feel free to ask locals for advice and they will be happy to help you.

### ieat Ultimate Food Trail

You can't go wrong following the recommendations of [famous food blogger Dr Leslie Tay](http://ieatishootipost.sg/).

Check out his [Singapore's Ultimate Food Trail post](http://bit.ly/ieatUltimateFoodTrail) and the [map](http://bit.ly/ieatUltimateFoodTrailmap).

### Kaya Toast with Eggs

[Yakun](http://www.yakun.com.sg/) - these stores are everywhere.

You can get this at the drink stall in almost every hawker centre. Ask for "breakfast set".

### Nasi Lemak

This is a traditional Malay dish of chicken, coconut rice and other nice things.

- [Coconut Club](https://www.thecoconutclub.sg) has a hip vibe and serves good Nasi Lemak.
- [Wild Coco](https://wildcoco.sg) is another great option for lunch.

### Carrot Cake

Go into any hawker centre and you'll find carrot cake. There are two varieties,
black and white. You can order for a mix of both as well. Try [He Zhong Carrot Cake](https://maps.app.goo.gl/FdJePP7j5G7NGiZo7).

### Popiah

A spicy roll and a great option for vegetarians.

![Popiah](/images/popiah.jpg)

### Chicken Rice

This is a very famous Singaporean dish made of –you guessed it– chicken and rice.

- Tian Tian in the Maxwell Food Centre is good but the queues can get long. So arrive early if you go there for lunch.
- Boon Tong Kee has multiple locations throughout the city.
- Chin Chin at Purvis street is a good option as well.

### Ice Kacang

A local dessert made of shaved ice that's perfect for sunny days. Most hawker centres have a stall that sell one. You can check out Old Airport Road Hakwer Centre and Funan Food Court. 

![Ais Bor](/images/ais_bor.jpg)

### Tsui Kway / Chwee Kueh

This is an odd one, again from hawker centres. Rice cakes sprinkled with salted radish.

### Laksa

Spicy noodle soup.

### Bak Kut Teh

Pork in a herb soup..

### Rojak

Rojak is a great local dish for vegetarians. Another staple of any food centre.

### Dim Sum

Not a traditional Singaporean dish but always a good option.

The most popular Hong Kong style dim sum (aka. yum cha) restaurant at the
moment is [Tim Ho Wan](https://www.timhowan.com/our-stores/#location-singapore) - their pork buns are a "must try".

![Pork Buns](/images/tim_ho_wan_pork_buns.jpg)

### Kway Chap

Kway Chap is a Teochew dish of flat, broad rice sheets in a soup made with dark soy sauce, served with pig offal, braised duck meat, various kinds of beancurd, preserved salted vegetables, and braised hard-boiled eggs. Fit for the slightly adventurous!

[Pictures of Kway Chap via Google](https://www.google.com.sg/search?q=kway+chap+singapore&es_sm=91&source=lnms&tbm=isch&sa=X&ei=rRiqU7e_CsmHuAS3yYGQBA&ved=0CAgQ_AUoAQ&biw=1916&bih=986)

### Chilli Crab

Singapore is very famous for its chilli crab.

[Jumbo Seafood](https://www.jumboseafood.com.sg/en/home) is classic in a nice setting, but can be expensive. Ask for prices before you order.

[Mellben](https://www.mellbensignature.sg/mellben-seafood/) is a more local option, albeit a bit out of the way. Try their Crab Bee Hoon if you go there. 

### Wanton Noodles

Worth visiting [Foong Kee Coffee Shop](http://www.hungrygowhere.com/singapore/foong_kee/)
in Chinatown.

![Wanton Min](/images/wanton_min.jpg)

### Putu Piring / Kueh Tutu

Putu Piring is steamed rice cake filled with gula melaka (melted palm sugar). Served with grated coconut, squares of pandan leaf, has subtle, sweet vanilla fragrance.

## Coffee Culture

While there are many western-style cafes and popular chains throughout the island, local coffee culture is something you must experience. Best places to try local coffee are neighbourhood confectionaries or hawker centres. In local lingo, coffee is known as Kopi (and tea is Teh for that matter). There's a comprehensive vocabulary developed on how to order coffee (it is fun to learn and great way to immerse).

You can learn more about Kopi lingo from [KopiJS](http://www.kopijs.org). They also have a regular meetup, which you can join for kopi adventures and meet interesting people.

## Cat Cafes

> Time spent with cats is never wasted.

## Drinks

### Cocktails

### Singapore Sling

A historical, [gin-based cocktail](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singapore_sling) from Singapore. If you're arriving via Singapore Airlines, feel free to request for the Singapore Sling on board. Most convenience stores around Singapore (7 Eleven/Cheers) have pre-mixed bottles ready for consumption and you may consider purchasing a bottle or two to enjoy!

The quintessential place to drink it is at the 2 storey Long Bar in Raffles Hotel (accessible to the public), the birthplace of the cocktail. Expect to pay matching prices.

## Shopping

One of the two major passions (the other being eating) of Singaporeans. Ask any local for their recommendations on places to shop and this particular shopping district will come up: Orchard Road. This 2.2km belt is one of Singapore's premier district for shopping. Located amidst cultural landmarks, lively street activities and dazzling architectural landscapes, you'll be sure to spend at least a full day there if you love shopping!

### Electronics

- Sim Lim Square

  Good for electronics, lower floors specialise in audio, video and cameras.
  Shop around for the best prices and check warranties before plonking down
  your hard-earned cash. Some bargaining may be possible. Caveat: not all shops
  are trustworthy. When signing on any documents, be sure to read carefully through the fine print!

  Nearest MRT station: Rochor (Downtown Line).

- Sim Lim Tower

  Electronic components and spare parts. Nerd paradise.

- Funan Square

  Slightly more up-market version of Sim Lim Square. Prices probably higher than
  Sim Lim, but comes with a more pleasant shopping experience.
  Challenger mega-store on top floor.

  Nearest MRT stations: City Hall (East West and North South Lines), Clarke Quay
  (North East Line).
